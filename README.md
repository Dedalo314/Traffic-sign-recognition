# Traffic-sign-recognition
Traffic-sign-recognition uses computer vision to detect and identify traffic signs in a picture or a frame. It uses deep learning and neural networks, and can be easily expanded to recognize more signals. All the data used for its training is included. 
For it to work, OpenCV and FANN (Fast Artificial Neural Network) are needed. Currently, it is only supported on linux distributions, and it has been tested in Debian 8, 9 and 10.
